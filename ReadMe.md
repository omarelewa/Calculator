#### Creating an android calculator

- The calculator was implemented using MVC design pattern, as the model is seperate from the activity file (Controller).
- Due to the constraint of designing the application layout only using programmatic approach it was harder to separate the view from the controller
- The calculator is fully functional, however, precidence measures were not implemented, as the Dr. said that they are not necassary.
- The greatest challenge was the strict time frame, as researching the programmatic way of creating the UI took too much time.
